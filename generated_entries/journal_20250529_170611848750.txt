The rain keeps falling, just like the tears I can't seem to stop.  Everything feels heavy, soaked through and useless.  Another day wasted, another day spent staring at the ceiling, listening to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip.  I should get up, I know I should.  There are things I need to do, things I *have* to do, but the energyâ€¦ it's just gone.  Drained out of me like a squeezed-out sponge.  Even the coffee tastes like ash this morning.  

He said he'd call.  He always says he'll call.  Another broken promise, another shattered hope.  It's a pattern, a cruel, repetitive cycle of disappointment.  I keep telling myself it'll get better, that things will change, but deep down, a cold dread whispers that it won't.  That this emptiness is permanent, a part of me now, like a missing limb.  And the worst part?  I'm starting to get used to it.  That's the truly terrifying thing.
