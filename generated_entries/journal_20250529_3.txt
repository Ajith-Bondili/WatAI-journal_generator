So, uh, today was… something. I saw Mark at the grocery store.  He, like, totally avoided me.  Which, okay, maybe I’m reading into it, but we had that thing, you know?  The awkward thing.  With the, um, spilled coffee.  And then the misplaced umbrella. It was a whole… situation. I tried to, like, make eye contact, but he just… grabbed a box of cereal and sped off.  I think he might be mad?  Or maybe he just hates cereal now.  It’s possible. Cereal is kind of… much.  Too many choices.  I ended up getting the same brand as always, even though I’d been thinking about trying that new one with the… uh…  the purple box. But then I thought, what if *I* hate it?  And then what?  It’s a whole thing.  A whole cereal thing.  And now, I’m home, and I’m thinking about Mark and cereal.  It’s probably not a good sign.  Maybe I should just… I don’t know.  Eat the cereal.  Yeah. Cereal. That's a plan.
