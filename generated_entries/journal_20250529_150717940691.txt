So, um, today was… a thing. I think?  I mean, I went to the grocery store, which is usually pretty mundane, but somehow I ended up accidentally buying three bags of oranges.  Three!  I don't even *like* oranges that much.  I think maybe I was distracted by, like, a squirrel? Or maybe a particularly vibrant display of… canned peaches? I can't really remember.  It's all a bit of a blur.  Then, uh, I tried to make toast.  Burnt it.  Completely.  Black as night.  It was… an experience.  I also spilled coffee on my shirt.  Again.  I’m starting to think I might be cursed or something.  Or maybe just clumsy.  Probably clumsy.  Anyway, I spent a good hour trying to get the coffee stain out, but I think it’s just… permanently there now.  A dark, coffee-shaped reminder of my… less-than-stellar day.  I’m thinking of just wearing it as a badge of honor, you know?  A symbol of my… awkwardness. Yeah. That sounds about right.
