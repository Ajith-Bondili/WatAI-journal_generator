The rain outside matches the downpour inside me.  Another day of this aching emptiness.  It’s not a dramatic, earth-shattering sadness, more a dull, persistent ache, like a tooth that’s been throbbing for weeks.  I try to distract myself, to fill the silence, but it’s no use. The silence just screams louder.  Even the things that used to bring me joy – the books, the music, even the comforting weight of my cat on my lap – feel flat, lifeless.  I look at the pictures on my phone, memories of happier times, and they only intensify the feeling of loss.  It’s not a specific loss, not one I can pinpoint or name, just a general sense of… wrongness.  Like a melody played slightly out of tune, constantly jarring and unsettling.  I keep telling myself it will pass, that this too shall pass, but the words feel hollow, unconvincing, even to me.  I just want the ache to stop.  Just for a little while.
