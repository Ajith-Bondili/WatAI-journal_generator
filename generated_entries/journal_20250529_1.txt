So, today was… a thing.  I tried to make muffins.  Blueberry muffins.  The recipe seemed simple enough, but then the batter was… wrong.  Too thick? Too thin? I don't know, I'm not a muffin scientist.  They ended up… lumpy.  And a bit… burnt.  On the bottom. Mostly.  I ate one anyway.  It wasn't terrible.  But it wasn't good, either.  It was just… there.  Like a beige, slightly charred, blueberry-flavored existential crisis on a plate.  Then I tried to clean the muffin tin.  And I think I might have broken it.  Slightly.  I'm not sure.  It’s a bit… wobbly now.  Maybe I'll just… throw it away.  And the muffins.  Or maybe I'll eat the rest of them.  I don't know.  Decisions, decisions.  This whole day has been a series of increasingly questionable choices.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.  Probably not.  But maybe.  I hope so.  Because this… this was awkward.  Very awkward.  And I’m slightly worried about the muffin tin.
