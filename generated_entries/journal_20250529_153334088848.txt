So, the dog, Buster, he ate my slippers!  My favorite, fuzzy, purple slippers! I came home, expecting a quiet evening, and there he was, tail wagging innocently, a fluffy purple fuzzball clinging to his whisker. I just… stared.  I couldn't believe it!  He’s never done anything like that before.  He usually just chews on his toys, or maybe a stray sock if he's feeling particularly mischievous.  Purple slippers?  That’s a whole new level.  I'm still kind of speechless.  I mean, I laughed, of course.  It was so unexpected! But also,  I'm frantically searching for a replacement pair now.  Purple is surprisingly hard to find!  This whole thing is just… wow.  He’s such a goofball. I can't stay mad at him, though.  Maybe I should get him a new toy shaped like a slipper?  Or ten.  This is a very surprising turn of events.  I need more coffee.
