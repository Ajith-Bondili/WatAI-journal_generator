The old oak tree in the park still stands, I’m sure of it.  I remember climbing it as a kid, feeling the rough bark against my knees, the sun warm on my face.  It felt so impossibly tall then, a giant reaching for the sky.  Now, thinking about it brings a smile, a warmth that spreads through me.  It was a simpler time, filled with scraped knees and ice cream stains.  Summer days stretched endlessly, filled with the laughter of friends and the comforting rhythm of sprinklers on the lawn.  We’d spend hours building forts, our imaginations running wild, creating worlds in the overgrown corner of the park.  Even the mundane feels special, like the way the streetlights cast long shadows on our walk home.  Sometimes, I catch a scent – freshly cut grass, or the sweet smell of honeysuckle – and it all rushes back, vivid and bright. Those were the days.  It makes me long for that carefree feeling, that innocent joy.
