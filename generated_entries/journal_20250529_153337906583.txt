I can't believe it!  I actually won the baking competition!  I mean, *really* won.  I entered on a whim, mostly to get out of the house and maybe snag a free cupcake.  My lemon poppy seed muffins?  They were…fine.  Nothing spectacular.  I expected to be soundly beaten by Mrs. Gable and her prize-winning sourdough.  She’s practically a baking deity in this town!  But the judge, a renowned pastry chef from the city, said mine were "unexpectedly delightful," which is a far cry from the polite "good effort" I usually get.  I'm still reeling.  I have a blue ribbon!  And a $50 gift certificate to the fancy bakery downtown.  I'm considering buying a whole cake.  Or maybe a dozen more muffins.  This is…insane.  I'm so surprised! I might even enter next year.  Who knew I was a secret baking prodigy?  This is the best surprise ever!
