So, uh, today was… a thing. I saw Mark at the grocery store.  We, like, kind of awkwardly made eye contact for a really long time.  I think I might have stared.  He was with his… dog? I think?  It was small and fluffy, and I'm pretty sure it was a dog.  Anyway, I tried to, like, subtly look away, but then I tripped over my own feet.  Not a dramatic fall, just a little stumble, but enough to make me want to disappear. He chuckled.  A real, genuine chuckle.  I'm pretty sure he found it funny. Which, I mean, it was pretty funny.  I'm clumsy.  It's a known fact.  I should probably get better at not tripping in front of people I have a… you know… a thing for?  Or maybe just avoid grocery stores altogether. Yeah, maybe that's the best option.  Or maybe I should just… I don’t know.  I’m overthinking this.  It's just a grocery store.  Right?  Right.  Definitely just a grocery store.  And a dog.  And Mark.  And me being a total klutz.  Okay, I’m done now.
