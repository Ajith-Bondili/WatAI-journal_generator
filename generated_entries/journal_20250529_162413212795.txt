So , um , today was… a thing . I think ? I mean , I went to the grocery store , which is , like , a normal thing , right ? But then , I saw Mrs. Gable , from down the street . And she , uh , asked about my… my… * project * . The one I ’ m , you know , * working on * . The one I haven ’ t actually started yet . I mumbled something about it being… complicated . Which is true , I guess . Complicated in that I haven ’ t even thought about it . She smiled , that tight-lipped smile she does , and I just… I wanted the earth to swallow me whole . Then , I bumped into a display of , like , artisanal cheeses . They all fell . Everywhere . It was… a mess . I ended up helping the teenage employee clean it up , which was… awkward . We didn ’ t talk much . Mostly just avoided eye contact and the pungent smell of goat cheese . I think I ’ ll just stay home tomorrow
