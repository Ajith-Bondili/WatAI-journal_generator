So , um , today was… a thing . I mean , not a * bad * thing , exactly , but definitely not a * good * thing either . More like a… beige thing ? I think . Anyway , I saw Mark at the grocery store . Which is fine . Except I was wearing my pajamas . I know , I know , terrible , right ? I ’ d , uh , overslept , and just… grabbed the first thing I saw . They ’ re actually pretty comfy pajamas , you know , the kind with the little feetsies . But probably not appropriate for public consumption . He kind of… stared . I think . Or maybe he was just looking at the avocados . I do n't know . I tried to make eye contact , but then I dropped my bag of frozen peas . All over the floor . It was… mortifying . Then I mumbled something about needing more peas for my… uh… pea soup . Which I don ’ t even make . I just… panicked . I 'm pretty sure he thought I was a total weirdo
