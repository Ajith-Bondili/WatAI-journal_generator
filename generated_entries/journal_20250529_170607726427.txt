The rain outside matches the downpour inside me.  Another day bleeds into another, each one blurring into a gray, indistinguishable mess.  I woke up with a headache, a dull ache that mirrors the persistent ache in my chest.  The coffee tasted bitter, like ashes.  Even the cat avoided me today, usually a furry comfort.  He probably senses my misery.  Work was a torment; the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous song of despair.  I just stared at the computer screen, the words swimming before my eyes, meaningless.  Coming home didn't bring any relief.  The apartment feels empty, echoing with silence and regret.  I should probably eat something, but the thought of food feels like a chore, another burden.  I just want to curl up and disappear, to fade away into the quiet misery of the night.  Tomorrow will probably be the same.  Another day of this pointless struggle.
