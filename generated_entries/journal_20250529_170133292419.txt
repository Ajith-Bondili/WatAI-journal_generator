The old wooden swing set creaked a familiar tune as I pushed myself back and forth, the rusty chains singing a song only my childhood understood.  The sun felt warm on my face, just like it did all those summers ago, the scent of freshly cut grass thick in the air.  I remember building magnificent kingdoms in the dirt beneath the oak tree, kingdoms that held more magic than any fairy tale.  Each swing was a journey, a flight to faraway lands filled with imaginary friends and endless adventures.  The chipped paint on the swing seat, faded now to a ghostly white, held the ghost of a thousand scraped knees and sun-kissed smiles.  Even the buzzing of the cicadas seemed louder, more vibrant, a soundtrack to a simpler time.  It's funny how a simple swing set can hold so many memories, so much of a life lived in slow motion, a life I wish I could revisit just one more time.  The afternoon light faded, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, a beautiful closing scene to a perfect nostalgic day.
