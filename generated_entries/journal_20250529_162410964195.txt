Um, so today was… a thing.  I saw Mark at the grocery store, and, like, I totally froze.  He was with his… girlfriend? I think?  She was really tall, and had, um, bright purple hair.  I just… stood there.  For a while.  Probably too long.  I mumbled something about needing milk and then practically ran away.  My face is probably still red.  I hope he didn’t notice. Or maybe he did and he thinks I’m weird.  Which I probably am.  I mean, who just freezes up like that?  It’s not like I even like him, like, *like* like him.  It’s just… awkward.  The whole thing was incredibly awkward. I should have just said hi. Or maybe not.  Ugh.  This is why I hate grocery shopping.  And people.  And mostly myself right now.  I think I’ll just eat ice cream and watch bad reality TV to forget about this entire mortifying experience. Maybe I’ll order extra ice cream. A lot of ice cream.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Lots and lots of ice cream.
