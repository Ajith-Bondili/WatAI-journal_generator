Well, I'll be hornswoggled!  Agnes finally agreed to go to the opera with me!  I've been asking for months, practically begging, and she always said it was "too stuffy" or "too long."  I even bought those ridiculously expensive tickets to *La Bohème* thinking that might sway her, but I honestly didn't think she'd actually go.  She even picked out the outfit *she* wanted to wear!  A shimmering emerald green dress, can you believe it?  I thought she'd wear something practical and dark, like always. This is a complete 180 from her usual response. I'm completely flabbergasted!  I'm practically giddy with excitement.  Maybe she's finally softening up to my… refined tastes.  Or maybe she's just feeling particularly adventurous tonight.  Either way, I’m not complaining!  This is going to be a night I won't forget.  I might even have to buy her a ridiculously expensive bouquet of flowers after the show!
