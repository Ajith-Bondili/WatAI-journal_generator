Found Grandma Rose's old photo album today.  Spent hours looking through it.  The smell of old paper and faded ink… just like her perfume, faint but sweet.  Pictures of me as a little girl, pigtails flying, grinning at the camera.  Remember that red dress?  She made it for me.  So many picnics in the park, her laughter echoing in my ears.  The blurry snapshots of family vacations—the beach, the mountains… all a hazy, golden memory now.  Seeing Uncle David's goofy grin in that one picture made me smile.  He’s gone now, but he’s still here, somehow, in these pictures.  Even the chipped paint on the porch swing in the background feels familiar.  It's funny how a photo can hold so much more than just an image.  It holds the warmth of a summer day, the sound of a loved one’s voice, the feeling of being completely and utterly loved.  Going to call Mom tomorrow.  We should dig out some of her old albums too.
